    "I found a [bread flour][Azure Bread Flour] from [Azure Standard] with a flavor\n",
    "and color I enjoy. The Unifine milling process reduces the bran and germ to small enough particles that they are not noticeable in the texture. Oven spring is good, but the air-pockets are not large, unlike [Tartine][Tartine3] bread. The texture is good but a little dense. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Azure Bread Flour] extraction (90%) is higher than the recommended 85% for High-Extraction and 75% for Medium-Strong. So assuming my turning and forming skills are not to blame (*dubious assumption*), I'm going to try blending flours  to achieve the recommended extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blending the bread flour with All-Purpose flour (0% extraction) provides a simple solution. [Azure Standard] has an [unenriched All-Purpose Flour][Azure All-Purpose Flour]. We can avoid any questions about whether enriching is healthy since the bread flour and the whole grain flours typical of [Tartine][Tartine3] recipes should compensate for any nutrients removed from the All-Purpose flour. The amount of All-Purpose flour required is a small fraction (~6%) of the total flour.\n",
