# Bread

A blending equation for high extraction and medium strong bread flour is
developed using Jupyter Notebook.

The equations are implemented in an Excel spreadsheet, which also works in
Google Sheets. However, Google Sheets will copy the Excel file if you select
Edit with Sheets instead of read only. Basically you'll end up with a duplicate
file.

The spreadsheet includes page references to Tartine 3. The values from the
Tartine recipes have been removed to respect Chad Robertson's copy right.

- The spreadsheet is protected, so un-protect, no password required, to edit
  the spreadsheet.
- On the Tartine tab, the cells with an orange background are editable with the
  sheet protected. Enter values or pick from the drop-down menus, as
  applicable.
- On the FlourData tab, the source data from publicly available information is
  linked to the associated web URL.
- To add FlourData, un-protect the tab and add a row to the table (Tab key from
  the last row, last cell). Excel will automatically update the tables on the
  Tartine tab.
